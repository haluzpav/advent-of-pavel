# Advent of Pavel

Project containing my implementation of [Advent of Code][aoc][^aoc].

Written in plain Kotlin on JVM, using Gradle for build system, and JUnit for unit-tests.

Each year is in separate `yearYYYY` module, with `core` module containing shared helper functions.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
